## mat-lii-analysis

This is modular program to model and analyze time-resolved laser-induced
incandescence (TiRe-LII) signals.


#### Details

This program is built to simulate signals from various materials,
including soot, silicon, germanium, iron, silver, and molybdenum.
Signals are generated predominantly using absorption, conduction,
and evaporation submodels, with capabilities to do other cooling
modes.
